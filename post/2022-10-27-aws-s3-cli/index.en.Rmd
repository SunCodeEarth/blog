AWS s3 (Simple Storage Service) is one of the simplest Amazon Web Service. It works just like a network drive. Amazon has granted many public institutions free S3 buckets. Smithsonian Institute (SI) is one of them. With its open access initiative, SI also shared a large amount of data on s3. 

- [Smithsonian Open Access on github](https://github.com/Smithsonian/OpenAccess)

- [AWS registry for Smithsonian](https://registry.opendata.aws/smithsonian-open-access/)

The data largely contain metadata at SI, 3D models, and pictures. To access the data, [the AWS CLI tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) can be used. CLI commands for S3 is available [there, too](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-s3-commands.html).

```{bash aws-s3, eval=FALSE}

# List all buckets and objects
>aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://smithsonian-open-access/

                           PRE 3d/
                           PRE media/
                           PRE metadata/
              
# List all recursively in the entire bucket
>aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://smithsonian-open-access/media --recursive

# aws s3 mv can copy a single file. 
# aws s3 sync can copy/overwrite the entire bucket/folder.
>aws s3 sync --no-sign-request s3://smithsonian-open-access/metadata/edan/saampaik ./saampaik

```
