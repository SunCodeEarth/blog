# Set up Python on Mac OS

## Mamba forge package

The best solution so far is to use [MiniForge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/) release. The Mamba Forge combination is the most efficient one. Download and run the Shell (.sh) installation file in Mac terminal. Use `mamba init zsh` to initialize Python for the terminal. **zsh** is the default shell for Mac OS. If a different shell is used, just change the parameter in `mamba init`. After doing this, it works just like the regular **MiniConda**. All the conda and package commands can be run in the initialized terminal.
