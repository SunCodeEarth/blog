How to start using R blogdown for effortless blogging.

<!--more-->

- Install blogdown package in RStudio

- Start a new project "Website using Blogdown"

  - This will install hugo automatically if it is not installed yet.

- Choose a favorite theme on hugo website

- Create a new website using the theme

```{r Blogdown Initialization, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}

install.packages('blogdown')

# Install Hugo and a theme
# blogdown::install_hugo("0.99.0")
# blogdown::install_theme(theme = 'halogenica/beautifulhugo', force = TRUE)

# This uses the popular beautiful hugo theme (my personal favorite)
blogdown::new_site(dir='newdir', theme = 'halogenica/beautifulhugo')

# Now you can create new post, either using the tools in Addins or using blogdown functions

blogdown::new_post(title='start using blogdown')

```

- Knit R markdown and Build Website
  - Turn on the `Knit on Save` option is you want to have automatic knitting.
  - `Build Website` is on the Build panel on the right side.
  - The final site is in the "public" folder of the project.
