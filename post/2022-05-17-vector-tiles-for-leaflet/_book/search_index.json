Rem Install the core with Python applications. Alternatively, it can be installed using OSGeo4W. However, OSGeo4W can interfere with PostgreSQL/PostGIS on GDAL for the setting. Therefore, it is not recommended to use OSGeo4W for GDAL. 0.1.1 GIS Internals By default, it is installed under C:\\Program Files\\GDAL. We can start with GDAL specified command terminal C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\cmd.exe /k \"C:\\Program Files\\GDAL\\GDALShell.bat\" The Shell correctly set all the environmental variables in the terminal. This is how it avoids the conflicts with PostGIS and turns out to be a better option than OSGEO4W. 0.2 Running GDAL Tools 0.2.1 Show the database information with tables ogrinfo.exe PG:\"host=localhost port=5432 dbname=nycod user=postgres password=postgres tables='ap,ap_census'\" Show all the records in the table (don’t do this if the table is very big) ogrinfo.exe PG:\"host=localhost port=5432 dbname=nycod user=postgres password=postgres\" \"rivers\" 0.2.2 Try to export to MVT Change directory to the folder where you want to save the data.
