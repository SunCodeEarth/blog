## Access Census data in Python

Since Census publicized its data access [API to developers](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html), many Python pacakges had been developed to take advantage of that. Currently, there is a very long list of Python packages that allow use to access census data via scripts.

- **census** (work best with package `us`)
- **censusdis** (census discovery)
- cenpy
- census-data-downloader (for ACS data)
- **pygris** (for tiger boundary files)

## Access Census data in R

There are also many packages in R that facilitate census data accsess. Here is a short list. In addition, many packages focus one specific datasets, instead of the geneal decennial census and ACS. 

- tidycensus
- tigris
- [censusapi](https://www.hrecht.com/censusapi/)
- totalcensus
- ipumsr
