Finding the shortest path between two points within a (simple) polygon can be efficiently solved by using the funnel algorithm. For more details, see [blog 1](http://digestingduck.blogspot.com/2010/03/simple-stupid-funnel-algorithm.html), [blog 2](http://ahamnett.blogspot.com/2012/10/funnel-algorithm.html), [Paper 1](img/Stanford_CS269_handout7.pdf) and [Paper 2](img/Mulzer_Shortest_Paths_in_Polygons.pdf).

A good implementation in Python is available at [GitHub margaeor](https://github.com/margaeor/map-shortest-path)
