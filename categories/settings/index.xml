      <description>Microsoft and other manufacturers had been releasing more arm64-based laptops and tablets. However, it is still quite inconvenient to set those computers for scientific computation in Python, R, etc. Overall, it is not recommended to use an arm64 Windows computer for data science works. Here are a few possible solutions.
General Solution In general, we can use it as a Linux computer with WSL2. However, not all computational platforms/environments are available on Linux systems like Ubuntu.</description>

      <description>Global Protect from Palo Alto Networks (PAN) is a widely used VPN client. However, it is quite annoying that the program will automatically start even when we just occasionally use the VPN to connect to remote computers. Here are a few clues to disable the autostart of Global Protect on Windows and Mac, respectively.
Windows 11 Computers It seems PAN plays the game quite well. It is not easy to use the normal methods to disable the auto start.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt  Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA), run for the public&amp;rsquo;s benefit. We give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can.
 Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt Client ACME Clients help create certificates for the sites and get them validated through Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt.
Win-ACME win-acme is a good ACME client for Windows Server IIS.</description>

      <description>Acquired a new ebook reader Rakuten Kobo Elipsa. The device has a good size at 10 inch. It also supports Dropbox for loading books and OverDrive for borrowing from public libraries.
A few useful settings:
DoubleCommander: A open-source alternative to TotalCommander. A more powerful and more convenient file explorer.
Briss: A open source PDF cropper. It is running on Java. Windows removes Java by default, but many programs, like ArcGIS Pro, installed their own Java Running Environment (JRE).</description>
