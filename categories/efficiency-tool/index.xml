      <description>Three criteria to evaluate if a package or library is suitable for processing very large datasets.Implement core functions in a language that is efficient for computation
C, C++, FORTRAN, Rust are rather good on this.Python, R, and other high-level languages are not very good.Support multithreading and even distributed computing
Relying on single core, single thread would not produce good performance.It is necessary to support multi-threading, either on the same computer or a clusterEnable efficient indexing</description>
