      <description>As many are working from home during/after the pandemic, it is super convenient and even necessary to remotely connected to office computers or home computers. However, wirelessly connected devices or ISP-connected devices may have their IP updated from time to time.

The information is saved into a text file, which can be saved in Dropbox or other cloud drives.</description>
